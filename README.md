# Lab2
Mapping
Lab 2 was an exciting assignment that allowed us to interact with the world in real time.
There were a lot of highlights and things to learn from during this process. 
One of the more important lessons learned was python and the cpabilities of its code when paired with the right enviorment. 

The comparison that I made was about the two time durations. The data was collected nearly in the same moment and as for place,
they were both collected on twitter. What I noticed when changing the time to 10 seconds I found a lot less data and when it was at 60 seconds there was much more data, obviously. What was intersting was when I delveoped my word cloud the words weren't all to different in terms what was being used. 

My assingment will show the code that was manipulated by myself and corresponding maps and the list of data that was analyzed.
